# Object Oriented Programming in Ruby

## What is OO (Object Orientation)?
- we will define objects
- providing organization and structure to your code
- encapsulation - we group together attributes (data) and functionality
- classes are the blueprints we use to make objects that have like attributes (variables) and functionality (methods)

## Ruby Classes
- Syntax:
```ruby
class Breakfast
end
```

## Instantiating a class
- What is instantiation?
  - creating an instance of an object
  - scope comes into play - an instance of a class creates its own scope
  - we have a blueprint, the class, and instantiation means creating one of those things, bringing the object "to life"
